This is a project to create a powerful CMS for both the user and owner but yet displayed as simple as a personal blog. It is designed to accept plug-ins that are created by third parties as well as a fully theme-able system. The power is behind what the owner sets up. It could be as simple as a blogging site or as powerful as a full fledged commercial site.

The ideas have been taken from some of the popular CMS, Forum and Blogging systems available to the public as well as other popular sites that host other content.

Currently at the time of this posting, I am building this solo and trying to teach myself new things. As I learn, new options become available and new ideas pop up.
